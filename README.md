AppleScript to Launch 8 remote desktop windows and resize for MacBook Pro 13in Retina
This is a simple AppleScript that was written for the sole purpose of launching Apple Remote Desktop, taking control
of 8 specific Mac Mini computers and then re-sizing and re-arranging all 8 windows so that they fit in a nice little
grid on my 13inch MacBook Pro Retina.  This script is pretty buggy at the moment and needs a lot of polishing.
It is my first attempt at AppleScript.
